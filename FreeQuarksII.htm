<h1>Where have all the Free Quarks Gone?</h1>
<p><em>Prof. Heidi Newberg<br />
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</em></p>

<p>This is the story of the Universe.  The details may not all be
true, but it's what we tell our students.</p>

<p>Universe began as an infinitely dense point in space.  The
particles and the physics are exotic.</p>

<p>At 10<sup>-30</sup>&nbsp;s, the Universe expands by a factor of
10<sup>26</sup>, in a process we call Inflation.</p>

<p>10<sup>-14</sup>&nbsp;s later, baryons and antibaryons annihilate
and we are left with a quark-gluon plasma, in which quarks can exist
by themselves, outside of a hadron.</p>

<p>Well, some are in neutrons too, but not all the flowers were picked
by young girls, either.</p>

<p>The protons and neutrons bind together into nuclei of light elements,
mostly hydrogen.</p>

<p>300,000 years after the Big Bang, hydrogen atoms form, the CMBR is
released, the dark ages begin, and last until quasars and the first
stars light up the Universe.</p>

<p>Matter falls into black holes that will eventually be the nuclei of
galaxies, emitting light as quasars.  Also, a generation of very
massive and short lived stars (Population III) is created.  These
energetic events reionize the gas.  <em>Stars are numbered in order of
their discovery, which is the opposite of the order they appeared.
The Sun is Population I, older stars are Population II, and the first
stars, which have never been directly observed, are Population
III.</em></p>

<p>The heavier elements of the periodic table are created by fusion in
the centers of massive stars, and then released into the interstellar
medium in supernova explosions, that end these stars' lives.</p>

<p>The enriched gas is made into Pop II stars in small clusters.</p>

<blockquote><p>

Long time ago.<br />

Formed dwarf galaxies every one.<br />
When will it ever end?<br />

</p></blockquote>

<p>These clusters hierarchically merge to make ever larger
galaxies.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Where have the dwarf galaxies gone?<br />
Long time passing.<br />
Where have the dwarf galaxies gone?<br />
Long time ago.<br />

Merged to make the Milky Way.<br />
And they are merging still.<br />
