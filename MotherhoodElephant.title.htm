<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Published in <u>Motherhood, the Elephant in the Laboratory:
Women Scientists <span class=GramE>Speak</span> Out</u>, edited by Emily <span
class=SpellE>Monosson</span>; this is the original submission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have walked the straight and narrow path to success in
physics.  I went straight from college to
graduate school, straight from graduate school to a postdoc, accepted my first
tenure-track position five years after my PhD, and was tenured at age 38.
At no point in my career did I ever dare to
dream that this would be possible.  And even
now, I wonder how long my career in research will last, or how successful I can
continue to be.   never doubted my own
intelligence or skillfulness.  But I have
always known I wanted children and a happy family more than I wanted a
successful career as a physicist.  I will
not dedicate my whole life to science as some around me do.
And that is where my career ambitions have
always wavered.  Is it really possible to
do both?  Is it possible to be a
successful scientist, to make discoveries, without dedicating one's full
attention?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:27.0pt'>I came up against this question
when I was a senior in college and deciding whether or not to go to graduate
school.  I remember meeting a Nobel
laureate while visiting graduate schools.
I told him I really liked hobbies like music and drawing and crocheting
and dance, and I wanted to know if I could still keep up these hobbies and go
to graduate school in physics.  He told
me that learning physics was really, really difficult, and it probably was not
worth doing unless you dedicated yourself to it full time.
In retirement there would be opportunities
for pursuing hobbies.

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This well-meaning professor answered the way I expected him
to answer, though not the way I had hoped.
I had worked hard all of my life -- first on our family farm and then in
undergraduate school.  I was not afraid
of hard work.  But really, dedicating my
life at age 21?  Five to seven years of
graduate school seemed possibly more than I was willing to commit to.
And having babies in retirement was an unworkable
plan.  But when I received my acceptance
letter to go to the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Berkeley</st1:place></st1:City>
physics program, something in the pit of my stomach told me I really wanted to
go.  For me it has always been one step
at a time, always asking myself at each step if I am still using my life the
way I want to, wondering at all times whether the system would deflect me from
my goal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have done some things differently to balance family life
with a career as a scientist.  I took a
postdoc position at a national laboratory because they were fairly certain the
position would last five years, and not
one-year-at-a-time-with-possibly-a-total-of-three years-contingent-on-funding
positions offered at major research universities.
Unfortunately for me, I had difficulty
conceiving a child and did not become a mother until the last year of my five
year postdoc.  I stayed at the national
laboratory for a total of seven years, and though I expect that conditions
there were much better than for postdocs at research universities, there are some
ways in which conditions could be improved.
Some things are simple, like daycare close to office areas and
facilities for using a breast pump.  But
the primary need of a new mother is time to take care of her child, and herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText style='margin-left:0in'>My first daughter we adopted, and
one year later I gave birth to a second.
My children came at about the time I was up for promotion to a
tenure-track position at the laboratory, which I succeeded in getting after a
fight.  I took three months of leave for
each child, as did my husband.  We
juggled our schedules so that we each worked three days per week and took two
days of leave per week so that we could keep the babies at home as long as
possible and keep things going at work.
It was a condition of my employer that all of my vacation time be used
up as part of the guaranteed three months of (otherwise unpaid) leave afforded
by the Family Leave Act.</p>

<p class=MsoBlockText style='margin-left:0in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText style='margin-left:0in'>When my children were one and two
years of age, I had two children in diapers and in daycare full time.
At least one of the children was sick every
other week.  Before I became a parent,
the five weeks per year of vacation time I received had seemed infinite.
Now my vacation coupled with my husband's
seemed barely adequate to cover the days when the kids were sick.
But, my older daughter was almost three and
mostly potty-trained.  I was starting to
build up a cushion of vacation time so that I wouldn't have to worry about
having it when the kids were sick and maybe we could think about taking a
vacation.  Then, at a kids' birthday
party / barbeque, my younger daughter put both hands directly on the charcoal
grill and received second degree burns on both palms.
My nerves were shot.
My daughter was out of daycare for a week with
bandaged hands and required almost constant care.
My cushion of vacation was gone.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.5in'>I returned to work, but I was
beginning to feel that I could not keep going this way.
I asked my supervisor if I could work 80%
time.  I planned to work four days per
week -- whichever four days neither of my kids were sick.
My supervisor agreed, but the division head
would not sign the papers without talking to me first.
The division head thought I might be able to
work this out, without losing pay, by working from home part of the time.
I tried to explain to him that one- and
two-year-olds don't play by themselves very long, and about the problems when
they become sick.  He told me that he and
his wife didn't have any children, and they just worked all of the time.
I wasn't sure how to respond to that.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:6.0in'>To his credit, the division head
signed the papers, and I worked for a year at 80% time.
In reality, I'm sure I often worked forty
hours per week with this schedule, but I didn't feel guilty about the time I
spent with my children.  It amounted to
about two months of leave, and may easily have saved my sanity and my career.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:6.0in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:6.0in'>When my children were two and three
years old, I was offered a job at a research university near where my extended
family lives.  The opportunity came at a
time when my relationship with the national laboratory was strained, and though
I had some concerns about juggling a family and a faculty position, I took the
lateral move.  I wouldn't say taking on a
faculty position is easy -- with or without children -- but I worked through
learning to teach, advise, and write grant proposals using extensive time
management techniques and constant prioritization.
I was awarded tenure after five years on the
faculty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:6.0in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:6.0in'>My husband and I have recently added
two more children to our family -- one adopted and one by birth, so I have
experienced new motherhood at a university.
On paper my university has a great family leave policy: one semester
without teaching (nominally a two day per week commitment at my university) and
an optional additional semester without teaching at half pay.
My younger children arrived 16 months apart,
so I have taught one semester in the last five semesters, and the policy has
worked exactly as intended.  I have been
able to keep up my research, write grants, advise students, and fulfill my
service functions to the university while spending some extra needed time with
my children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:6.0in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:6.0in'>Because I need to cover childcare
for after school, school holidays, days when any of my four children are sick,
and full time care for two very young children, we have employed a nanny this
time around.  It is possible to hire wonderful
young women to care for children if one is able to pay a living wage, which is
rare in the childcare industry.  Our
childcare bills alone, which are mostly paid after taxes, eat up half to three
quarters of my (reduced) income.  We are
lucky to be able to spend at a small deficit for the few years before preschool
and public schools significantly reduce our childcare needs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:6.0in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:6.0in'>I remember thinking as an
undergraduate that a faculty position is the perfect job for a mother because
the hours are flexible and it is easy to reduce the workload without changing
the job description -- one just teaches fewer classes.
In some ways it has been easier, because the
university really can lower the work load by reducing the number of classes I
teach. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:6.0in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:6.0in'>The part that does not work is the
same part that did not work at the national lab -- the perception of my
supervisor and my colleagues is that I am not working as hard as everyone
else.  I have tried to educate people
that I am paid less to do less work.  I
have tried to educate my peers that I am not on sabbatical; I am still on
campus doing everything I would normally do except teach.
And when I am on half pay, I work much more
than half of the time I would normally work.
I am currently half time and pay a 40 hour per week nanny to take care
of my children.  Part of what fuels the
resentment is that other faculty members are asked to teach the classes I
normally would teach instead of or in addition to their normal class
loads.  Although it states in the
handbook that funds will be provided to cover a replacement instructor during
my family leave, there is no money actually set aside anywhere in the university
to cover these costs -- the money must be squeezed out of the budgets that are
already in place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:6.0in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:317.25pt'>My children are now aged 11, 9,
2, and infant -- two sets of two.  And I
am again feeling the strain in my relationship with my employer.
Despite recently surviving the tenure process
and international attention to my research, administrators at the university
have told me I am underproductive.  This
is not unlike the discussions I had with administrators at the national
laboratory when my older two children were toddlers.
Though there are many stressful things
happening at my university that have nothing to do with my motherhood, the
similarity in timing -- coinciding with the birth of young children -- makes me
wonder if the real problem is my decision to take time off to have children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:317.25pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:317.25pt'>Years ago, a 40-year-old friend
of mine who had resigned her position in the management of a bank after
adopting two children told me that they look at you differently when you work
part time.  The kinds of assignments and
the available options shrink.  "You'll
see," she told me.  Now I am 40, and I
think I see.  I am no less able, no less
ambitious, no drag on the organization who pays my salary.
When I did less work, I took less salary in
accordance with the written and agreed employment policies.
I do not expect to be "mommy-tracked" now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:317.25pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:317.25pt'>As I do often in my career, I am
again asking myself if I am doing what I really want to do.
A few months ago, I asked my nine-year-old
daughter if she cared if her mother stayed an astronomer.
She got a long look on her face, and told me
she liked my being an astronomer because I could help her with things that
other mothers couldn't.  She smiled when
I assured her that even if I weren't working, I would still know everything I
know now.  A mother told me once when I
was a young girl that education is never wasted on women; I guess she was
right.  And boy, do I have a lot of
education!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:317.25pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:317.25pt'>Last month, I was awarded two NSF
grants back-to-back.  I gave an invited
talk at an international conference.  I
was invited to visit <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to give several lectures, all expenses paid.
I am not ready to leave science.
Though even as a 40-year-old tenured professor, I'm still not ready commit
my life to my job.</p>
